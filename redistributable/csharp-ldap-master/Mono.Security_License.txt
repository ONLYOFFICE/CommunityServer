The following text is taken from http://mono-project.com/License on 22 June 2010:


    What license or licenses are you using for the Mono Project?

      We use four open source licenses:

        * The C# compiler is dual-licensed under the MIT/X11 license and the GNU General Public License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.html) (GPL). 

        * The tools are released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.html) (GPL). 

        * The runtime libraries are under the GNU Library GPL 2.0 (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/library.html#TOC1) (LGPL 2.0). 

        * The class libraries are released under the terms of the MIT X11 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html) license. 

        * ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET AJAX client software are released by Microsoft under the open source Microsoft Permissive License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html). 


Although it is not clear from the Mono project web site, Mono.Security.dll would seem to be a
class library, and therefor be released under the MIT X11 License, which is included here for
convenience:
