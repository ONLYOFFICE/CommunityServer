<br />
<br />

<h2><b>Features</b></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Written from scratch on Visual Studio 2008 specifically for ADO.NET,
    implementing all the base classes and features recently introduced in the
    framework, including automatic transaction enlistment.
  </li>

  <li>
    Supports the Full and Compact .NET Framework, and native C/C++ development.
    100% binary compatible with the original sqlite3.dll.
  </li>

  <li>
    Full support for Mono via a &quot;managed only&quot; provider that runs
    against the official SQLite 3.6.1 or higher library.
  </li>

  <li>Full Entity Framework support (ADO.NET 3.5 SP1).</li>

  <li>
    On the Compact Framework, it is faster than SQL Server Mobile.  SQLite's
    installed size is a fraction of SQL Mobile's.  It uses less memory at
    runtime, runs queries faster, and has a smaller database file size as well.
  </li>

  <li>
    Encrypted database support.  Encrypted databases are fully encrypted and
    support both binary and cleartext password types.
  </li>

  <li>
    Visual Studio design-time Support, works with all versions of Visual Studio
    2005/2008/2010.  You can add a SQLite database to the Servers list, design
    queries with the Query Designer, drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet,
    etc.
    <br />
    <font color="red">
      Due to Visual Studio licensing restrictions, the Express Editions can no
      longer be supported.
    </font>
  </li>

  <li>
    Full SQLite schema editing inside Visual Studio.  You can create/edit tables,
    views, triggers, indexes, check constraints and foreign keys.
  </li>

  <li>
    Single file redistributable (except on Compact Framework).  The core SQLite
    native code and the ADO.NET managed wrapper are combined into one mixed-mode
    assembly.
  </li>

  <li>
    Binaries included for x86, x64, Itanium, and ARM processors.
    <br />
    <font color="red">
      Itanium processor support not currently included.
    </font>
  </li>

  <li>DbProviderFactory support.</li>

  <li>
    Full support for ATTACH'ed databases.  Exposed as <i>Catalogs</i> in the
    schema.  When cloning a connection, all attached databases are automatically
    re-attached to the new connection.
  </li>

  <li>
    DbConnection.GetSchema(...) support includes <i>ReservedWords</i>,
    <i>MetaDataCollections</i>, <i>DataSourceInformation</i>, <i>DataTypes</i>,
    <i>Columns</i>, <i>Tables</i>, <i>Views</i>, <i>ViewColumns</i>,
    <i>Catalogs</i>, <i>Indexes</i>, <i>IndexColumns</i>, <i>ForeignKeys</i> and
    <i>Triggers</i>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Enhanced DbDataReader.GetSchemaTable() functionality returns catalog,
    namespace and detailed schema information even for complex queries.
  </li>

  <li>Named and unnamed parameters.</li>

  <li>
    Full UTF-8 and UTF-16 support, each with optimized pipelines into the native
    database core.
  </li>

  <li>
    Multiple simultaneous DataReaders (one DataReader per Command however).
  </li>

  <li>
    Full support for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions, encapsulated
    into an easy-to-use base class in which only a couple of overrides are
    necessary to implement new SQL functions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Full support for user-defined collating sequences, every bit as simple to
    implement as user-defined functions and uses the same base class.
  </li>

  <li>
    Full source for the entire engine and wrapper.  No copyrights.  Public
    Domain.  100% free for commercial and non-commercial use.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Design-Time Support</strong></h2>
<p>
Download and run one of the setup packages and then select the
&quot;<b>Install the designer components for Visual Studio 20XX.</b>&quot;
option when prompted.
</p>
<h2>
<strong>DbFactory Support (Non-Compact Framework)</strong></h2>
In order to use the SQLiteFactory and have the SQLite data provider enumerated in
the DbProviderFactories methods, you must add the following segment into your application's
app.config file:<br />
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.data&gt;
        &lt;DbProviderFactories&gt;
            &lt;remove invariant="System.Data.SQLite" /&gt;
            &lt;add name="SQLite Data Provider" invariant="System.Data.SQLite" description=".Net Framework Data Provider for SQLite"
                 type="System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteFactory, System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.80.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139" /&gt;
        &lt;/DbProviderFactories&gt;
    &lt;/system.data&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
<p>
See the help documentation for further details on implementing both version-specific
(GAC enabled) and version independent DBProviderFactories support.
</p>

<h2>Compiling for the Compact Framework</h2>

<p>
Just change the target platform from Win32 to Compact Framework and recompile.&nbsp;
<strong>The Compact Framework has no support for enumerating attributes in an assembly,
therefore all user-defined collating sequences and functions must be explicitly
registered.</strong>&nbsp; See the <strong>testce</strong> sample application for
an example of how to explicitly register user-defined collating sequences and functions.</p>

<h2><b><a name="redist"></a>Distributing The SQLite Engine and ADO.NET Assembly</b></h2>

<p>
On the desktop, only the <strong>System.Data.SQLite.DLL</strong> file needs to be
distributed with your application(s).&nbsp; This DLL contains both the managed wrapper
and the native SQLite3 codebase.&nbsp; For the Compact Framework, you will have
to distribute both the CF version of System.Data.SQLite.DLL, as well as the SQLite.Interop.XXX.DLL.&nbsp;
This is a breaking change as of 1.0.59.0.&nbsp; Recent Windows Mobile frameworks
are not supporting the mixed CF assembly I was building prior to this version.</p>

<h2><b>Development Notes Regarding the SQLite 3 Source Code</b></h2>

<p>
The core SQLite engine is compiled directly from the unmodified source code available
at the sqlite.org website.&nbsp; Several additional pieces are compiled on top of
it to extend its functionality, but the core engine's source is not changed.</p>
<p>
</p>

    <li>When tracing SQL statements to be prepared, bypass the internal length limit of the sqlite3_log function by using the SQLiteLog class directly instead. Also, detect null and/or empty strings and emit a special message in that case.</li>
    <li>For the setup, the Visual Studio task should only be initially checked if the GAC task is available and vice-versa.</li>
    <li>Improve compatibility with custom command processors by using __ECHO instead of _ECHO in batch tools.</li>
    <li>Add OpenAndReturn method to the SQLiteConnection class to open a connection and return it.</li>

    <li>When emitting SQL for foreign keys in the VS designer, be sure to take all returned schema rows into account. Remainder of fix for [b226147b37].</li>
    <li>Add Flags connection string property to control extra behavioral flags for the connection.</li>
    <li>Refactor all IDisposable implementations to conform to best practices, potentially eliminating leaks in certain circumstances.</li>

    <li>When returning schema information that may be used by the .NET Framework to construct dynamic SQL, use a fake schema name (instead of null) so that the table names will be properly qualified with the catalog name (i.e. the attached database name). Partial fix for [343d392b51].</li>
    <li>Add SQLiteSourceId property to the SQLiteConnection class to return the SQLite source identifier.</li>
    <li>Add MemoryUsed and MemoryHighwater properties to the SQLiteConnection class to help determine the memory usage of SQLite.</li>

<li>Fixed the missing resources problem from the 63 release.</li>
<li>Added preliminary support for the Visual Studio 2010 beta.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteCommand that threw a null reference exception when setting

transaction scope, just return without throwing an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.63.0 - June 29, 2009</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.16</li>
<li>Check the autocommit mode of the connection to which a transaction is bound
during the disposal of the transaction.&nbsp; If autocommit is enabled, then the
database has already rolled back the transaction and we don&#39;t need to do it
during dispose, and can quietly ignore the step without throwing an error.</li>
<li>Eliminated the mergebin step altogether.&nbsp; It was developed primarily to
merge the Compact Framework binaries together, but since we&#39;re not doing that
anymore, its use is limited.&nbsp; Its non-standard method of merging a binary on
the desktop framework is redundant as well.&nbsp; The desktop binary now hard-links
to MSCOREE, but as of Windows XP, this was redundant as well since XP and beyond
automatically attempt to load MSCOREE on startup when a DLL has a .NET header.</li>

message pumping</li>
<li>Fixed a bad pointer conversion when retrieving blobs using GetBytes() in 64-bit
land</li>
<li>Several changes to the Test program that comes with the provider.&nbsp; Tests
can now be individually disabled, and the test program can run against several provider
back-ends</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.61.0 - April 28, 2009</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.13. The new backup features are as yet unimplemented
in the provider, but will be forthcoming in a subsequent release</li>
<li>Fixed the default-value lookups in SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder when accessing
properties</li>
<li>Lock the SQLiteTransaction object during dispose to avoid potential race condition
during cleanup</li>
<li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader.GetDecimal() processing and parsing of decimal values
for cases when SQLite returns things like "1.0e-05" instead of "0.0001"</li>

<p>
<b>1.0.60.0 - October 3, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Throw a NotSupported exception in the EF Sql Gen code instead of parsing illegal
SQL during an update/insert/delete where no primary key is defined.</li>
<li>Fixed the Compact Framework interop library.&nbsp; Since the linker flag /subsystem
had no version specified, it was causing a problem for many CE-based platforms.</li>
<li>Incorporated SQLite patch for ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3387">
#3387</a> and reverted out the vfs override code I added in build 59 to work around
this problem.</li>
<li>Fixed a designer issue when creating a new table from the Server Explorer.&nbsp;
After initially saving it, if you then continued to edit it and tried to save it
again, it would generate the change SQL using the old temporary table name rather
than the new name.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.59.0 - September 22, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.3.&nbsp; Solves a couple different EF issues that
were either giving inconsistent results or crashing the engine.</li>
<li>Fixed the parsing of literal binaries in the EF SqlGen code.&nbsp; SQLite now
passes nearly all the testcases in <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/1377/5921.aspx#5921">
Microsoft's EF Query Samples</a> application -- the exception being the <i>datetimeoffset
</i>and<i> time</i> constants tests, and tests that use the <i>APPLY </i>keyword
which are unsupported for now.</li>
<li>Revamped the Compact Framework mixed-mode assembly.&nbsp; Tired of playing cat
and mouse with the Compact Framework&#39;s support for mixed-mode assemblies.&nbsp;
The CF build now requires that you distribute both the System.Data.SQLite library
and the paired SQLite.Interop.XXX library.&nbsp;&nbsp; The XXX denotes the build
number of the library.</li>
<li>Implemented a workaround for Vista&#39;s overzealous caching by turning off
FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS for OS versions above XP.&nbsp; This is implemented as a
custom (default override) VFS in the interop.c file, so no changes are made to the
SQLite source code.</li>
<li>Fixed some registry issues in the designer install.exe, which prevented some
design-time stuff from working on the Compact Framework when .NET 3.5 was installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.58.0 - August 30, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.2.&nbsp; If only I&#39;d waited one more day to release
57!&nbsp; Several LINQ issues have been resolved with this engine release relating
to deeply-nested subqueries that the EF SqlGen creates.</li>
<li>The Rollback SQLiteConnection event no longer requires an open connection in
order to subscribe to it.&nbsp; Missed this one in the 57 release.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.57.0 - August 29, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Compiled against 3.6.1 with checkin <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3300">
#3300</a> resolved, which fixes an Entity Framework bug I was seeing.&nbsp; I currently
have 3 other tickets out on the engine, which are not yet resolved and relate to
EF.</li>
<li>Fixed decimal types to store and fetch using InvariantCulture.&nbsp; If you&#39;re
using decimal datatypes in your database and were affected by the 56 release, please
issue an UPDATE &lt;table&gt; SET &lt;column&gt; = REPLACE(&lt;column&gt;, &#39;,&#39;,
&#39;.&#39;);&nbsp; to fix the decimal separators.&nbsp; Apologies for not testing
that more thoroughly before releasing 56.</li>
<li>Too many LINQ fixes to list.&nbsp; Fixed views so they generate, fixed the LIMIT
clause, implemented additional functionality and removed unnecessary code.</li>
<li>Fixed foreign key names in the designer so viewing the SQL script on a new unsaved
table after renaming it in the properties toolwindow will reflect in the script
properly.</li>
<li>Fixed the Update and Commit events on SQLiteConnection so they don&#39;t require
the connection to be opened first.</li>
<li>Fixed userdef aggregate functions so they play nice with each other when appearing
multiple times in the same statement.</li>
<li>Fixed the editing and saving of default values in the table designer.</li>
<li>Fixed ForeignKeys schema to support multi-column foreign keys.&nbsp; Also hacked
support for them in the table designer, provided two foreign keys in the designer
have the same name and reference the same foreign table and different columns.&nbsp;
Will implement first-class support for this in the next release.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.56.0 - August 11, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the table designer when designing new tables, wherein you had
to save the table first before being able to create indexes and foreign keys.</li>
<li>Tweaks to decimal type handling.&nbsp; The &#39;decimal&#39; type can&#39;t
be represented by Int64 or Double (without loss of precision) in SQLite, so we have
to fudge it by treating it like a string and converting it back and forth in the
provider.&nbsp; Unfortunately backing it to the db as a string causes sorting problems.&nbsp;
See <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/1296/5595.aspx#5595">this post</a>
for details on using a custom collation sequence to overcome the sorting issue arising
from this patch.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks and bugfixes to the test program and the provider.</li>
<li>More adjustments to make the managed-only version of the provider run and pass
all tests on Mono.</li>
<li>LINQ to Entities bits heavily updated and compiled against VS2008 SP1 RTM.&nbsp;
SQLite LINQ support is still considered beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.55.0 - August 6, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.1</li>
<li>Added support for the user-contributed extension-functions at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/contrib">
http://www.sqlite.org/contrib</a>.&nbsp; Feel free to override any of them with
your own implementation.&nbsp; The new functions are: <i>acos, asin, atan, atn2,
atan2, acosh, asinh, atanh, difference, degrees, radians, cos, sin, tan, cot, cosh,
sinh, tanh, coth, exp, log, log10, power, sign, sqrt, square, ceil, floor, pi, replicate,
charindex, leftstr, rightstr, reverse, proper, padl, padr, padc, strfilter,</i>
and aggregates <i>stdev, variance, mode, median, lower_quartile, upper_quartile.</i></li>
<li>Moved the last_rows_affected() function to the C extension library.</li>
<li>Added a new class, SQLiteFunctionEx which extends SQLiteFunction and adds the
ability for a user-defined function to get the collating sequence during the Invoke/Step
methods.&nbsp; User-defined functions can use the collating sequence as a helper
to compare values.</li>
<li>When registering user-defined collation sequences and functions, the provider
will now register both a UTF8 and a UTF16 version instead of just UTF8.</li>
<li>Revamped connection pooling and added static ClearPool() and ClearAllPools()
functions to SQLiteConnection.&nbsp; Behavior of the pool and its clearing mechanics
match SqlClient.</li>
<li>Fixed connections going to the pool so that any unfinalized lingering commands
from un-collected datareaders are automatically reset and any lurking transactions
made on the connection are rolled back.</li>
<li>Transaction isolation levels are now partially supported.&nbsp; Serializable
is the default, which obtains read/write locks immediately -- this is compatible
with previous releases of the provider.&nbsp; Unspecified will default to whatever
the default isolation mode is set to, and ReadCommitted will cause a deferred lock
to be obtained.&nbsp; No other values are legal.</li>
<li>Revamped the test.exe program.&nbsp; It&#39;s now an interactive GUI application.&nbsp;
Easier for me to add tests now.</li>
<li>Tweaks to the VS designer package and installer.</li>
<li>More adjustments to the internal SQLite3.Prepare() method to account for both
kinds of lock errors when retrying.</li>
<li>Stripped a lot of unnecessary interop() calls and replaced with base sqlite
calls.&nbsp; Revamped most of UnsafeNativeMethods to make it easier to port the
code.</li>
<li>Rerigged internal callbacks for userdef functions and other native to managed
callbacks.&nbsp; More portable this way.</li>
<li>Source can now can be compiled with the SQLITE_STANDARD preprocessor symbol
to force the wrapper to use the stock sqlite3 library.&nbsp; Some functionality
is missing, but its minimal.&nbsp; None of the precompiled binaries are compiled
using this setting, but its useful for testing portability.</li>
<li>Added &quot;boolean&quot; and a couple other missing datatypes to the &quot;DataTypes&quot;
schema xml file.&nbsp; Used by the VS designer when displaying tables and querying.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Read Only&quot;.&nbsp; When set to
True, the database will be opened in read-only mode.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Max Pool Size&quot; to set the maximum
size of the connection pool for a given db file connection.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Default IsolationLevel&quot; to set
the default isolation level of transactions.&nbsp; Possible values are Serializable
and ReadCommitted.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string option &quot;URI&quot; as an optional parameter
for compatibility with other ports of the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.54.0 - July 25, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the setup project, which somehow &quot;forgot&quot; to include all the
binaries in the 53 release.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the table designer when creating a new table and tabbing past
the &quot;Allow Nulls&quot; cell in the grid while creating a new column.</li>
<li>Fixed a mostly-benign bug in SQLiteDataReader&#39;s GetEnumerator, which failed
to pass along a flag to the underyling DbEnumerator it creates.&nbsp; This one&#39;s
been around since day 1 and nobody&#39;s noticed it in all these years.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string parameter &quot;Journal Mode&quot; that allows
you to set the SQLite journal mode to Delete, Persist or Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.53.0 - July 24, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Enabled sqlite_load_extension</li>
<li>Added retry/timeout code to SQLite3.Prepare() when preparing statements for
execution and a SQLITE_BUSY error occurs.</li>
<li>Added a new schema to SQLiteConnection.GetSchema() called <i>Triggers</i>.&nbsp;
Used to retrieve the trigger(s) associated with a database and/or table/view.</li>
<li>Extensive updates to table/view editing capabilities inside Visual Studio&#39;s
Server Explorer.&nbsp; The program now parses and lets you edit CHECK constraints
and triggers on a table, as well as define triggers on views.&nbsp; Experimental
still, so e-mail me if you have issues.</li>
<li>Minor bugfix to the ViewColumns schema to return the proper base column name
for a view that aliases a column.</li>
<li>Fixed the insert/update/delete DML support in the Linq module.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of SQLiteCommand to allow a transaction to be set even
if the command hasn&#39;t been associated with a connection yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.52.0 - July 16, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.0</li>
<li>Added a lot of previously-missing exports to the DEF file for the native library.</li>
<li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader to check for an invalid connection before operating on
an open cursor.</li>
<li>Implemented the Cancel() function of SQLiteCommand to cancel an active reader.</li>
<li>Added beta table and view designers to the Visual Studio Server Explorer.&nbsp;
You can now edit/create tables and views, manage indexes and foreign keys from Visual
Studio.&nbsp; This feature is still undergoing testing so use at your own risk!</li>
<li>Fixed the Server Explorer so VS2005 users can once again right-click tables
and views and open the table data.</li>
<li>Added some new interop code to assist in returning more metadata not normally
available through the SQLite API.&nbsp; Specifically, index column sort modes and
collating sequences.&nbsp; Also added code to detect (but not parse) CHECK constraints,
so the table designer can pop up a warning when editing a table with these constraints.&nbsp;
Since I can&#39;t currently parse them.</li>
<li>Lots of LINQ SQL generation improvements and fixes.</li>
<li>Made some progress cleaning up and fixing up the schema definitions and manifests
for EdmGen.</li>
<li>Added a built-in SQLiteFunction called last_rows_affected() which can be called
from SQL to get the number of rows affected by the last update/insert operation
on the connection.&nbsp; This is roughly equivalent to Sql Server&#39;s @@ROWCOUNT
variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.51.0 - July 1, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>VS2008 SP1 Beta1 LINQ Support</b></li>
<li>Added experimental Entity Framework support in a new library, System.Data.SQLite.Linq.&nbsp;
Some things work, some don&#39;t.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t finished rigging everything
up yet.&nbsp; The core library remains stable.&nbsp; All LINQ-specific code is completely
separate from the core.</li>
<li>Added some columns to several existing schemas to support some of the EDM framework
stuff.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks to the factory to better support dynamic loading of the Linq extension
library for SQLite.</li>
<li>SQLite&#39;s busy handler was interfering with the provider&#39;s busy handling
mechanism, so its been disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.50.0 - June 27, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some lingering dispose issues and race conditions when some objects were
finalized.</li>
<li>Fixed the SQLiteConvert.Split() routine to be a little smarter when splitting
strings, which solves the quoted data source filename problem.</li>
<li>Enhanced the mergebin utility to work around the strong name validation bug
on the Compact Framework.&nbsp; The old workaround kludged the DLL and caused WM6.1
to fail to load it.&nbsp; This new solution is permanent and no longer kludges the
DLL.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.49.0 - May 28, 2008</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.5.9</li>
<li>Fixed schema problems when querying the TEMP catalog.</li>
<li>Changed BLOB datatype schema to return IsLong = False instead of True.&nbsp;
This was preventing DbCommandBuilder from using GUID's and BLOB's as primary keys.</li>
<li>Fix rollover issue with SQLite3.Reset() using TickCount.</li>
<li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader to dispose of its command (if called for) before closing
the connection (when flagged to do so) instead of the other way around.</li>
<li>Fixed a DbNull error when retrieving items not backed by a table schema.</li>
<li>Fixed foreign key constraint parsing bug.</li>
<li>Added FailIfMissing property to the SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder.</li>
<li>Converted the source projects to Visual Studio 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.48.0 - December 28, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.5.4</li>
<li>Calling SQLiteDataReader.GetFieldType() on a column with no schema information
and whos first row is initially NULL now returns type Object instead of type DbNull.</li>
<li>Added support for a new DateTime type, JulianDay.&nbsp; SQLite uses Julian dates
internally.</li>
<li>Added a new connection string parameter "Default Timeout" and a corresponding
method on the SQLiteConnection object to change the default command timeout.&nbsp;
This is especially useful for changing the timeout on transactions, which use SQLiteCommand
objects internally and have no ADO.NET-friendly way to adjust the command timeout
on those commands.</li>
<li>FTS1 and FTS2 modules were removed from the codebase.&nbsp; Please upgrade all
full-text indexes to use the FTS3 module.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.47.2 - December 10, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed yet one more bug when closing a database with unfinalized command objects</li>
<li>Fixed the DataReader's GetFieldType function when dealing with untyped SQLite
affinities</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.47.1 - December 5, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a leftover bug from the codemerge with SQLite 3.5.3 that failed to close
a database.</li>
<li>Fixed the broken Compact Framework distribution binary.</li>
<li>SQLite 3.5.x changed some internal infrastructure pieces in the encryption interface
which I didn't catch initially.&nbsp; Fixed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.47.0 - December 4, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.5.3</li>
<li>Added installer support for Visual Studio 2008.&nbsp; Code is still using the
VS2005 SDK so one or two bells and whistles are missing, but nothing significant.</li>
<li>This is the last version that the FTS1 and FTS2 extensions will appear.&nbsp;
Everyone should rebuild their fulltext indexes using the new FTS3 module.&nbsp;
FTS1 and FTS2 suffer from a design flaw that could cause database corruption with
certain vacuum operations.</li>
<li>Fixed pooled connections so they rollback any outstanding transactions before
going to the pool.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Fixed the unintended breaking of the TYPES keyword, and mis-typing of untyped
or indeterminate column types. </li>
<li>Assert a FileIOPermission() requirement in the static SQLiteFunction constructor.
</li>
<li>The CE-only SQLiteFunction.RegisterFunction() is now available on the desktop
platform for dynamic registration of functions.&nbsp; You must still close and re-open
a connection in order for the new function to be seen by a connection.</li>
<li>Fixed the "database is locked" errors by implementing behavioral changes in
the interop.c file for SQLite.&nbsp; Closing a database force-finalizes any prepared
statements on the database to ensure the connection is fully closed.&nbsp; This
was rather tricky because the GC thread could still be finalizing statements itself.
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Modifed the mergebin utility to help circumvent a long-standing strong name
verification bug in the Compact Framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.46.0 - September 30, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed faulty logic in type discovery code when using SQLiteDataReader.GetValue().</li>
<li>Fixed Connection.Open() bug when dealing with :memory: databases.</li>
<li>Fixed SQLiteCommand.ExecuteScalar() to return a properly-typed value.</li>
<li>Added support for SQLiteParameter.ResetDbType().</li>
<li>Added test cases for rigid and flexible type testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.45.0 - September 25, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breaking change in GetSchema("Indexes") </strong>-- MetaDataCollections
restrictions and identifier parts counts were wrong for this schema and I was using
the wrong final parameter as the final restriction.&nbsp; Meaning, if you use the
Indexes schema and are querying for a specific index the array should now be {catalog,
null, table, index } instead of {catalog, null, table, null, index}</li>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.4.2</li>
<li>Fixed some errors in the encryption module, most notably when a non-default
page size is specified in the connection string. </li>
<li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader to better handle type-less usage scenarios, which also
fixes problems with null values and datetimes.</li>
<li>Fixed the leftover temp files problem on WinCE </li>
<li>Added connection pooling.&nbsp; The default is disabled for now, but may change
in the future.&nbsp; Set "Pooling=True" in the connection string to enable it. </li>
<li>Sped up SQLiteConnection.Open() considerably.</li>
<li>Added some more robust cleanup code regarding SQLiteFunctions.</li>
<li>Minor additions to the code to allow for future LINQ integration into the main
codebase.</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug in the Open() command of SQLiteConnection which failed
to honor the documented default behavior of the SQLite.NET provider to open the
database in "Synchronous=Normal" mode.&nbsp; The default was "Full". </li>
<li>If Open() fails, it no longer sets the connection state to Broken.&nbsp; It
instead reverts back to Closed, and cleans up after itself.</li>
<li>Added several new parameters to the ConnectionString for setting max page count,
legacy file format, and another called FailIfMissing to raise an error rather than
create the database file automatically if it does not already exist.</li>
<li>Fixed some designer toolbox references to the wrong version of the SQLite.Designer</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the mergebin utility with regards to COR20 metadata rowsize computations.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Minor documentation corrections &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.44.0 - July 21, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.4.1</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteConnection.Open() which threw the wrong kind of error in
the wrong kind of way when a database file could not be opened or created.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Small enhancements to the TYPES keyword, and added documentation for it in the
help file.</li>
<li>Hopefully fixed the occasional SQLITE_BUSY errors that cropped up when starting
a transaction.&nbsp; Usually occurred in high-contention scenarios, and the underlying
SQLite engine bypasses the busy handler in this scenario to return immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.43.0 - June 21, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.4.0</li>
<li>Fixed a reuse bug in the SQLiteDataAdapter in conjunction with the SQLiteCommandBuilder.&nbsp;
It's been there unnoticed for more than a year, so it looks like most folks never
encountered it. </li>
<li>Fixed an event handler bug in SQLiteCommandBuilder in which it could fail to
unlatch from the DataAdapter when reused.&nbsp; Relates to the previous bugfix.</li>
<li>Fixed a double-dispose bug in SQLiteStatement that triggered a SQLiteException.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.42.0 - June 1, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.17</li>
<li>Changed the SQLiteFunction static constructor so it only enumerates loaded modules
that have referenced the SQLite assembly, which hopefully should cut down dramatically
the time it takes for that function to execute.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Added the FTS2 full-text search extension to the project.&nbsp; Look for FTS1
to disappear within the next couple of revisions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced with the finalizers that triggered an error when statements
ended with a semi-colon or had other non-parsable comments at the end of a statement&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fixed an intermittent multi-threaded race condition between the garbage collector
thread and the main application thread which lead to an occasional SQLITE_MISUSE
error.</li>
<li>Fixed another issue relating to SQLite's inherent typelessness when dealing
with aggregate functions which could return Int64 or Double or even String for a
given row depending on what was aggregated.</li>
<li>Remembered to recompile the DDEX portion of the engine this time, so Compact
Framework users can once again use the design-time functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.41.0 - April 23, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.16</li>
<li>Second go at implementing proper finalizers to cleanup after folks who've forgotten
to Dispose() of the SQLite objects</li>
<li>Enhanced GetSchema(IndexColumns) to provide numeric scale and precision values</li>
<li>Fixed the column ordinals in GetSchema(IndexColumns) to report the ordinal of
the column in the index, not the table</li>
<li>Fixed a bug whereby parameters named with an empty string (such as String.Empty)
were treated like a named parameter instead of an unnamed parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.40.0 - January 31, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.12</li>
<li>Lots of new code to handle misuse of the library.&nbsp; Implemented finalizers
where it made sense, fixed numerous garbage collector issues when objects are not
disposed properly, &nbsp;fixed some object lifetime issues, etc.</li>
<li>A failed Commit() on a transaction no longer leaves the transaction in an unusable
state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.39.1 - January 11, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a really dumb mistake that for some reason didn't trigger any errors in
the testcases, whereby commands when associated with a connection were not adding
or removing themselves from an internal list of commands for that connection --
causing a "database is locked" error when trying to close the connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.39.0 - January 10, 2007</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.10</li>
<li>Fixed a multi-threaded race condition bug in the garbage collector when commands
and/or connections are not properly disposed by the user. </li>
<li>Switched the encryption's internal deallocation code to use sqlite's built-in
aux functions instead of modifying the pager.c source to free the crypt block.&nbsp;
This eliminates the last of the code changes the provider makes to the original
SQLite engine sources.&nbsp; Props to Ralf Junker for pointing that out.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.38.0 - November 22, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when using CommandBehavior.KeyInfo whereby integer primary key columns
may be duplicated in the results. </li>
<li>Enhanced the CommandBuilder so that update/delete statements are optimized when
the affected table contains unique constraints and a primary key is present.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the DataReader when used in conjunction with CommandBehavior.CloseConnection.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.37.0 - November 19, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for CommandBehavior.KeyInfo.&nbsp; When specified in a query,
additional column(s) will be returned describing the key(s) defined for the table(s)
selected in the query.&nbsp; This is optimized when INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is set for
the given tables, but does additional work for other kinds of primary keys.</li>
<li>Removed the default values from SQLiteDataReader.GetTableSchema(), to better
follow Sql Server's pattern and suppress schema errors when loading the records
into a dataset/datatable.</li>
<li>Allow integers to implicitly convert to double/decimal/single.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.36.1 - October 25, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for LONGVARCHAR, SMALLDATE and SMALLDATETIME. These were actually
added in 1.0.36.0 but were undocumented.</li>
<li>Fixed the embedded helpfile which was accidentally built from old sources. </li>
<li>Fixed an unfortunate re-entry of a bug in the .36 codebase that caused the provider
to "forget" about commands on a connection under certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.36.0 - October 23, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.8, including support for full-text search via the
FTS1 extension.&nbsp;</li><li>Fixed a bug retrieving data types when UseUtf16Encoding
is true. Side-effect of further merging the common code between the two base classes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with System.Transactions whereby a connection closed/disposed within
a transaction scope is rolled back and cannot be committed.</li>
<li>Added more error checking and reporting to transactions to help user's isolate
the source of transaction failures.</li>
<li>Implemented a workaround for a Compact Framework issue regarding strong-named
assemblies containing a PE section with a raw size less than the virtual size.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.35.1 - September 12, 2006</b></p>

subsequent statements of a semi-colon separated command cannot be parsed.</li>
<li>Updated the help documentation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.35.0 - September 10, 2006</b></p>

<li>Fixed an infinite loop bug in SQLiteCommand caused when multiple semi-colon
separated statements in a single command are executed via datareader and one of
the statements contains a syntax error preventing it from being prepared.&nbsp;</li><li>
Added the TYPES preparser keyword to be placed before a SELECT statement to aid
the wrapper in converting expressions in a subsequent select clause into more robust
types.&nbsp; Documentation yet to be integrated, but available on the forums.</li>
<li>Added a new connectionstring parameter "BinaryGUID=true/false" (default is "true").&nbsp;
When true, guid types are stored in the database as binary blobs to save space.&nbsp;
Binary has been the default format since 1.0.32.0 but this parameter eases backward
compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.34.0 - September 4, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteParameterCollection.RemoveAt(namedparam)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteDataReader introduced in 1.0.30 that broke DateTimes using
the Ticks option in the connection string.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the recent changes to guid behavior wherein using a datareader's
indexer to fetch a guid from a column containing both binary and text guids would
sometimes return a byte array instead of a guid.</li>
<li>Enacted a workaround involving typed datasets in Compact Framework projects
in which it took an excessive amount of time to open a form and generated a lot
of temporary files in the user's Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Assembly
References folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.33.0 - August 21, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.7</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteConnection that caused it to "forget" about commands bound
to it and occasionally throw an error when a database is closed and opened repeatedly.&nbsp;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.32.0 - August 6, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers attribute to the assembly</li><li>Added the
missing "nchar" type</li>
<li>Added support for binary Guid's.&nbsp; Guids are now stored as binary by default
when using parameterized queries.&nbsp; Text guids are still fully supported.</li>
<li>Fixed a TransactionScope() error that caused the transaction not to be completed.</li>
<li>Enhanced parameter names so that if they are added to the Parameters collection
without their prefix character (@ : or $) they are still properly mapped.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.31.0 - July 16, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-applied the view parsing bugfix in 1.0.29.0 that was accidentally reverted
out of the 30 build.</li><li>Fixed SQLiteCommand.ExecuteScalar() to return null
instead of DbNull.Value when no rows were returned.</li>
<li>Design-time installer now installs the package-based designer on full Visual
Studio versions.&nbsp; Express editions continue to use the packageless designer.</li>
<li>In Visual Studio (not Express), you can now right-click a SQLite connection
in the Server Explorer and vacuum the database and change the encryption password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.30.1 - July 2, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.6</li>
<li>Added support for the |DataDirectory| keyword in the Data Source filename string.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Added hook notification support to SQLiteConnection.&nbsp; Specifically, there
are three new events on the SQLiteConnection object which are raised when an update/insert/delete
occurs and when transactions are committed and rolled back.</li><li>Changed SQLiteTransaction
to default to BEGIN IMMEDIATE instead of just BEGIN, which solves a multithreaded
race condition.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Changed SQLiteDataReader to better support SQLite's typelessness.&nbsp; The
data reader no longer caches column affinity, but re-evaluates it for each column/row.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Prepare() which caused an intermittant fault due to the code
accessing the memory of an unpinned variable.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fixed a multithreaded lock-retry bug in in SQLiteConnection.Open() and in SQLiteTransaction,
which failed to use a command timeout before giving up.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.29.0 - May 16, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Views schema information which caused multi-line view definition
statements not to be parsed</li>
<li>Fixed a parsing bug in SQLiteDataReader.GetSchemaTable() to account for numeric(x,y)
datatypes with specified precision and scale</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteConnection.Open() which tried to automatically enlist in
an ambient transaction but had not yet set the state of the database to Opened,
thereby causing a transaction fault</li>
<li>Changed SQLiteException to inherit from DbException on the full framework</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.28.0 - April 14, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.5</li>
<li>You can now specify a relative path in the Compact Framework's "Data Source"
by prefixing the file with ".\".&nbsp; i.e. "Data Source=.\\mydb.db3"</li>
<li>Several more changes and enhancements to schemas for better compatibility.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs with the 64-bit builds of the provider.&nbsp; The x64 binary
is now optimized.</li>
<li>Design-time installer now tries to install the 64-bit builds into the GAC along
with the 32-bit build.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the SQLiteDataReader.GetSchemaTable() function when used with
tables containing apostrophes.</li>
<li>Fixed an XSD-related bug whereby the XSD utility was unable to locate the provider
and could not generate typed datasets.</li>
<li>Added NTEXT and STRING datatypes to the list of recognized keywords (used for
schema retrieval).</li>
<li>Due to the XSD bug and other potential problems related to external build utilities,
changes to the installation of the designer have had to be made.&nbsp; The installer
used to write the DbProviderFactories XML into the devenv.exe.config file and its
express cousins, but now has to write instead to the machine.config.</li>
<li>Installer writes to both the 32-bit machine.config and the 64-bit machine.config
if it exists.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.27.1 - February 28, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when doing data binding in Compact Framework projects that prevented
you from assigning a typed dataset to a bindingsource.&nbsp; It turns out, the CF
version of the SQLite provider needs to be flagged as retargetable so it'll work
in the design-time desktop environment.&nbsp; No changes were made to the desktop
build, but the revision was bumped on all libraries anyway in order to keep them
sync'd.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.27.0 - February 27, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Many optimizations and a few more minor adjustments to schemas and schema retrieval
performance.</li>
<li>Lots of design-time attributes added to the code.&nbsp; The DbDataAdapter, DbCommand,
and DbConnection objects now have greatly enhanced design-time capabilities when
added to the toolbox and dropped on a form.</li>
<li>Lots of Server Explorer enhancements.</li>
<li>Binaries are now distributed in a setup program for easier administration and
configuration of the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.26.2 - February 15, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Yet another bugfix to index schemas, which was incorrectly marking most indexes
as primary key indexes.</li><li>Fixed GetSchema() to accept a null string array.</li><li>
Fixed a misspelled export in the core C library that prevented databases opened
with UTF16Encoding from getting schema information and would likely cause an error
if attempted.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.26.1 - February 14, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed even more minor schema bugs having to do with indexes.</li><li>Added two
missing pieces in the SQLite designer which were preventing it from being used from
within VS Express editions.&nbsp;</li><li>Several bugfixes to the design-time installer
program, including supporting 64-bit environments.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.26.0 - February 11, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.4</li><li>Fixed an encryption bug when changing the
password of databases over 1gb in size.&nbsp;</li><li>Fixed various designer issues
related to construction of named parameters.</li>
<li>Retooled the GetSchema() method of SQLiteDataReader to use the new 3.3.4 API
functions, and made several enhancements and fixes to schemas.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Implemented the SourceColumnNullMapping property of SQLiteParameter to fix a
DbCommandBuilder code generation bug.&nbsp;</li><li>Removed the runtime dependency
on MSVCR80.DLL.&nbsp; File size is somewhat larger for the varying desktop versions.</li><li>
Created an install program to manage installation and uninstallation of the SQLite
design-time support.</li>
<li>Designer support now works for all Visual Studio editions, including all Express
Editions.</li>
<li>Design-time installer will now remove (if present) the machine.config SQLite
entries in favor of installing the xml code into the devenv.exe.config file (or
any of the variations for express editions).&nbsp; The officially-accepted behavior
of using DbProviderFactories is to add the code to your app.config file, and the
machine.config file should not be touched.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.25.0 - January 31, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.3.3</li><li>Added automatic distributed transaction
enlistment and implemented the DbConnection.EnlistTransaction method for manual
enlistment.</li>
<li>Nested transactions are now supported.</li>
<li>Rearranged the timing of SetPassword(), which now must be called before the
database is opened instead of afterwards.&nbsp; Optionally, the password can be
supplied in the ConnectionString.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteFunction that caused a failure when an empty resultset
was returned and a custom user aggregate function was used in the query.</li>
<li>The designer has had another round of cleanup applied, in preparation for moving
to a VS package.</li>
<li>Added SQLiteMetaDataCollectionNames class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.6 beta - January 23, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.2 beta.</li><li>Eliminated the static
linking of mscoree from all binaries.&nbsp; Native projects can now use the library
without any dependencies on the .NET framework, while managed projects continue
to be able to use the library normally.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.5 beta - January 20, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.1 alpha and contains development-in-progress
code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees can be made regarding its suitability for production
use.</li>
<li><strong>You no longer need to distribute 2 files on the CompactFramework.&nbsp;
You can delete SQLite.Interop.DLL entirely.&nbsp; </strong>I wrote a custom tool
called "mergebin" (available in the source zip file) which combines the two libraries
and gets around a glaring defect in the VS2005 linker for ARM processors which doesn't
allow you to link netmodules.</li>
<li><strong>x64 and ia64 builds now use the same strong name as the x86 build.</strong>&nbsp;
This means breaking backward compatibility, but it was necessary in order to allow
you to drop any of those 3 builds onto a PC and have your .NET program run properly.&nbsp;
Prior to this, you'd get an error if you built your program using the x86 build,
and then installed the x64 version on a target machine and tried to run your program
against it.</li>
<li>The entire source project has been gone over top to bottom.&nbsp; A debug build
no longer combines the binaries into a single module, which was preventing proper
debugging.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.4 beta - January 16, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.1 alpha and contains development-in-progress
code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees can be made regarding its suitability for production
use.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the UTF-16 handling code for preparing statements due to a behavioral
change in SQLite 3.3.0.</li>
<li>Added pager.c code necessary to cleanup after an encrypted file is closed.</li>
<li>Fixed an encryption bug that caused a fault when an encrypted file was rolled
back.</li>
<li>Modified the testcase code to take advantage of optimizations regarding the
use of a DbCommandBuilder.&nbsp; DataAdapter insert speed increased dramatically
as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.3 beta - January 10, 2006</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.0 alpha and contains development-in-progress
code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees can be made regarding its suitability for production
use.</li><li>Added support for database encryption at the pager level.&nbsp; Databases
are encrypted using a 128-bit RC4 stream algorithm.&nbsp; To open an existing encrypted
database, you may now specify a "Password={password}" text in the ConnectionString,
or you may call the SQLiteConnection.SetPassword() function to set the password
on an open connection. &nbsp;To encrypt existing non-encrypted databases or to change
the password on an encrypted database, you must use the SQLiteConnection.ChangePassword()
function.&nbsp; If you use SetPassword() instead of specifying a password in the
connection string, or call ChangePassword() you may use a binary byte array or a
text string as the password.</li>
<li>Rewrote the locking implementation for the Compact Framework.&nbsp; It is now
more robust and incorporates into the SQLite codebase more efficiently than the
previous CE adaptation.</li>
<li>Moved some of the embedded schema XML data into a resource file to ease code
readability.</li>
<li>Automated the fixup of the original SQLite codebase's source prior to compiling,
to ease merging with sqlite.org's source.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in SQLiteCommand due to it not removing an internal reference
to itself in SQLiteConnection.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.2 - December 30, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the SQLiteDataReader.HasRows property to return the proper value.</li>
<li>Implemented the inadvertently neglected RecordsAffected property on SQLiteDataReader.
</li>
<li>SQLiteFunction static constructor was changed to pre-filter classes with only
the SQLiteFunctionAttribute.&nbsp; The code was throwing an exception when certain
assemblies were referenced in a project. </li>
<li>Fixed the SQLiteDataAdapter OnRowUpdated event, which was using the wrong variable
to find the attached event handler and subsequently not raising the event.</li>
<li>Small optimizations and fixes to SQLiteDataReader.NextResult().&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24.1 - December 19, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Update core SQLite engine to 3.2.8&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.24 - December 9, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the<em> Catalogs</em> schema bug that caused attached databases not to
be re-attached to a cloned connection </li>
<li>Enhanced transactions to allow for a deferred or immediate writelock. &nbsp;SQLiteConnection.BeginTransaction()
now has an additional overload to support it&nbsp;</li><li>Commands are now prepared
as they are executed instead of beforehand.&nbsp; This fixes a bug whereby a multi-statement
command that alters the database and subsequently references the altered data would
fail during Prepare().</li><li>Tightened up the SQLiteDataReader to prevent reading
columns before calling the first Read() and to prevent reading columns after the
last Read().</li>
<li>A more descriptive error is thrown if there aren't enough parameters in the
command to satisfy the parameters required by the statement(s).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.23 - November 21, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Named parameters may now begin with <strong>@</strong> to ease portability of
the provider. SQLite's named parameters are ordinarily prefixed with a <strong>:
</strong>or<strong> $</strong>.&nbsp; The designer will still use the <strong>$</strong>
prefix however, since its more compatible with the default SQLite engine.</li><li>
Added several alternate ISO8601 date/time formats to SQLiteConvert.cs to increase
compatibility.</li>
<li>Relaxed coersion restrictions to work better with SQLite's inherent typelessness.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.22 - November 11, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some globalization issues which resulted in incorrect case-insensitive
comparisons</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the routine that finds all user-defined functions in a loaded
assembly.&nbsp; It would throw an exception if any of the types in the assembly
could not be loaded.&nbsp; The exception is now caught and handled appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.21 - November 4, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a designer bug when creating typed datasets with parameterized queries.</li>
<li>The above fix then exposed another bug in the datareader's ability to query
schema information on parameterized commands, which was also fixed.</li>
<li>Compiled against the RTM version of VS2005.</li>
<li>Rewrote the design-time install script to use the XML DOM objects when writing
to the machine.config and to automatically register the DLL in the GAC.</li><li>
Made changes to the app.config descriptions and help file to improve version-independent
factory support.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.20 - October 19, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shortcut in SQLiteBase.GetValue which was insufficient for international
environments.&nbsp; The shortcut was removed and the "proper" procedure put in.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.19 - October 5, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.2.7
<li>Fixed bugs in the CE port code (os_wince.c)&nbsp;which were brought to light&nbsp;by&nbsp;recent
changes in the SQLite engine.
<li>Recompiled and modified to be compatible with the September VS2005 Release Candidate.<br />
Beta 2 users should continue to use 1.0.18.1</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.18.1 - September 19, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.2.6</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.18 - September 1, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added type-specific method calls when using the various SQLite classes that
would've normally returned a a generic Db base class, which aligns the code better
with the Microsoft-supplied data providers.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.17 - August 26, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.2.5
<li>Added Itanium and x64 build settings to the project (needs testing)
<li>Bugfixes and enhancements to several schema types
<li>Additional design-time support to include index and foreign key enumerations.&nbsp;
Requires re-registering the designer using INSTALL.CMD.&nbsp; The new designer code
now allows the VS query designer and typed datasets to automatically link up foreign
keys, use indexes, and automatically generate relationships from the schema.<li>
Additional static methods on SQLiteConnection to create a database file, encrypt
a file using the Encrypted File System (EFS) on NTFS (requires NT 2K or above) and
NTFS file compression</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.16 - August 24, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.2.4 with the large delete bugfix in CVS (which will
become 3.2.5 soon)
<li>Added new GetSchema() types: IndexColumns, ViewColumns, ForeignKeys</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.15 - August 22, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with SQLite 3.2.3
<li>Minor updates for better design-time experience. More design-time code to follow
in subsequent releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.14 - August 16, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the SQLiteDataAdapter due to insufficient implementation of the
class.&nbsp; The RowUpdating and RowUpdated events are now properly implemented,
but unfortunately inserting and updating data in a DataTable or DataSet is now much
slower.&nbsp; This is the proper design however, so the changes are here to stay.
<li>Lots of schema changes to support Visual Studio's Data Designer architecture.<li>
Added Designer support for the provider.&nbsp; It's not 100%, but you can design
queries, add typed datasets and perform quite a number of tasks all within Visual
Studio now.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.13 - August 8, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a named parameter bug in the base SQLite_UTF16 class, which of course
only showed up when a database connection was opened using the UseUTF16Encoding=True
parameter.
<li>Fixed a performance issue in SQLite_UTF16 involving string marshaling.</li></ul>
</div>
<p>
<b>1.0.12 - August 5, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Full support for the Compact Framework.&nbsp; Each build (Debug/Release) now
has a&nbsp;platform, either Win32 or Compact Framework.&nbsp; The correct projects
are built accordingly.&nbsp; See the&nbsp;<a href="#redist">Distributing SQLite</a>
section for information on what files need to be distributed for each platform.&nbsp;
<li>Modified SQLite3.Reset() and Step() functions to transparently handle timeouts
while waiting on the database to become available (typically when a writer is waiting
on a reader to finish, or a reader is waiting on a writer to finish).
<li>Lots of code cleanup&nbsp;as suggested&nbsp;by the Code Analyzer (FxCop).
<li>Lots of updates to the helpfile (as you can see).
<li>Statements&nbsp;were already prepared lazily&nbsp;in a SQLiteCommand, but now
its even more lazy.&nbsp; Statements are now only prepared if the statements haven't
been previously prepared and a Prepare() function is called (and the command is
associated with a connection) or just prior to the command being executed.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
<p>
<b>1.0.11 - August 1, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For everything except the Compact Framework, System.Data.SQLite.DLL
is now the <em>only</em> DLL required to use this provider!</strong>&nbsp; The assembly
is now a multi-module assembly, containing both the native SQLite3 codebase and
the C# classes built on top of it.&nbsp; The Compact Framework version (when completed)
will not be able to support this feature, so backwards compatibility with the Compact
Framework has been preserved for the future.
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteCommand.ExecuteScalar() that caused it to stop executing
commands once it obtained the first column of the first row-returning resultset.&nbsp;
Any remaining statements after the row-returning statement was ignored. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.10 - June 10, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the SQLite3.cs Prepare() function that created a statement even
when the SQLite engine returned a NULL pointer. Typically this occurs when multiple
statements are processed and there are trailing comments at the end of the statement.
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteStatement.cs that retrieved parameter names for a parameterized
query.&nbsp; SQLite's parameters are 1-based, and the function was starting at 0.&nbsp;
This was fine when all parameters were unnamed, but for named parameters it caused
the parameters to be out of whack. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.09a - May 25, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a broken helpfile and corrected some obsolete help remarks in SQLiteFunction.cs
<li>Added a version resource to the SQLite.Interop.DLL.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.09 - May 24, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with the latest 3.21 version of SQLite.
<li>Removed obsolete methods and properties for Whidbey Beta 2</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.08 Refresh - Mar 24, 2005<br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>Code merge with the latest 3.20 version of SQLite.
<li>Recompiled the help file to fix a build error in it. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.08 - Mar 11, 2005<br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added additional #if statements to support the old beta 1 edition of VS2005.
<li>Code merged the SQLite 3.14 source. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.07 - Mar 5, 2005</b><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Made more optimizations to frequently-called functions, resulting in significant
performance gains in all tests.
<li>Recompiled the binaries using the latest VS2005 February CTP, resulting in yet
more significant speed gains.&nbsp; The 100k insert test used to take 3.5 seconds
and the insertwithidentity took almost 8 seconds.&nbsp; With the above two changes,
those tests are now executing in 1.9 and 4.9 seconds respectively.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.06 - Mar 1, 2005<br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed-ups to SQLiteDataReader.&nbsp; It was interop'ing unnecessarily every
time it tried to fetch a field due to a logic error.
<li>Changed/Added some code to SQLiteConvert's internal DbType, Type and TypeAffinity
functions.
<li>Fixed the SQLiteDataReader to obey the flags set in the optional CommandBehavior
flag from SQLiteCommand.ExecuteReader().
<li>Changed the default page size to 1024 to reflect the defaults of SQLite.&nbsp;
Ignores the "Page Size" connection string option for memory databases, as tests
revealed that changing it resulted in memory corruption errors.
<li>Performance enhancements to the SQLiteCommand and SQLiteStatement classes which
reduced the 100,000 row insert execution time as well as the various Function execution
times significantly. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.05 - Feb 25, 2005</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the SQLite3 C# class step/reset functions to accomodate schema changes
that invalidate a prepared statement.&nbsp; Statements are recompiled transparently.
<li>Moved all native DLL declarations to an UnsafeNativeMethods class.
<li>Split several classes into their own modules for readability.
<li>Renamed many internal variables, reviewed access to variables marked as internal
and altered their protection levels accordingly.
<li>Due to the presence of the altered sqlite3 codebase and so many added interop
functions, I decided to rename the sqlite3 C project and the DLL to SQLite.Interop.DLL.&nbsp;
This is the same core sqlite3 codebase but designed specifically for this ADO.NET
provider.&nbsp; This eliminates any possibility of someone dropping another build
of sqlite3.dll into the system and rendering the provider inoperable.&nbsp; In the
future if the folks at sqlite.org finally introduce a method of retrieving column
usage for an arbitrary prepared statement, I'll retool this library to be a lightweight
function call wrapper around the core binary distribution.
<li>Added [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity] attribute to the UnsafeNativeMethods class
which brings VS2005 November CTP execution speeds inline with the December CTP.
<li>Added a <b>bin</b> directory to the project root where pre-compiled binaries
can be found.
<li>Added a <b>doc</b> directory where preliminary documentation on the class library
can be found.
<li>Documented a lot more of the classes internally. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.04 - Feb 24, 2005</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the SQLiteContext class and revamped the way UserFunctions work to simplify
the imlementation.
<li>Fixed a counting bug in the TestCases class, specifically in the function tests
where I wasn't resetting the counter and it was consequently reporting intrinsic
and raw select calls as being much much faster than they actually were.&nbsp; The
numbers are now much closer to what I expected for performance, with .NET user-functions
still being the slowest, but only by a small margin.
<li>Small performance tweaks to SQLiteDataReader.
<li>Added PageSize to the SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder and subsequently to the
SQLiteConnection
<li>Added a PRAGMA encoding=XXX execution statement to the SQLiteConnection after
opening a connection. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.03 - Feb 23, 2005</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed up SQLiteCommandBuilder to correct implementation errors, which resulted
in an enormous performance boost in the InsertMany test.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,000 row
insert that executed in 1500ms now executes in 500ms.
<li>Fixed several errors in the SQLite3_UTF16 class.&nbsp; ToString() was working
incorrectly and the Open() method failed to register user defined functions and
collations.
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteCommand.ClearCommands() whereby only the first statement
was being properly cleaned up.
<li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteDataReader whereby calling NextResult() would not properly
reset the previously-executed command in the sequence.
<li>Added an InsertManyWithIdentityFetch test, which appends a select clause to
populate the ID of the last inserted row into the InsertCommand, demonstrating ADO.NET's
ability to auto-fetch identity columns on insert. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>1.0.02 - Feb 21, 2005</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Tweaks to the xxx_interop functions that return char *'s, so they also return
the length.&nbsp; Saves an interop call to get the UTF-8 string length during conversion
to a .NET string.
<li>Reworked the whole interop.c thing into interop.h and reduced the code required
to merge the main sqlite3 codebase.
<li>Added support for user-defined collations. </li>
</ul>
