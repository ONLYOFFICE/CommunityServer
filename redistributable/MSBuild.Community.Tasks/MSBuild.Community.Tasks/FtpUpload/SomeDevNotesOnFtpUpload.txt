There's a little duplication here between the Ftp and FtpUpload folders.
Sorry for that.  I had modified FtpUpload to use ITaskItem[] (which fits
better, I think, with MSBuild typical patterns) before I knew there was
an Ftp folder in source control.

Also, the FtpUpload task is set up with an interface to FtpWebRequest so
that it can be unit tested without an actual FTP server.
