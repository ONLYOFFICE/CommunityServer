                critical message routing services including the addressing of
                messages, the routing of responses, limiting message propagation,
                ordering of messages, and the unique identification of transactions.
                These header fields are in addition to the mandatory request line,

                If a request contained a To tag in the request, the To header field

                the response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in
                which a tag MAY be present).  This serves to identify the UAS that is
                responding, possibly resulting in a component of a dialog ID.  The

            #region RFC 3263 4.1 Selecting a Transport Protocol

            /* 4.1 Selecting a Transport Protocol

                If the URI specifies a transport protocol in the transport parameter,
                that transport protocol SHOULD be used.

                Otherwise, if no transport protocol is specified, but the TARGET is a
                numeric IP address, the client SHOULD use UDP for a SIP URI, and TCP
                for a SIPS URI.  Similarly, if no transport protocol is specified,
                and the TARGET is not numeric, but an explicit port is provided, the
                client SHOULD use UDP for a SIP URI, and TCP for a SIPS URI.  This is
                because UDP is the only mandatory transport in RFC 2543 [6], and thus
                the only one guaranteed to be interoperable for a SIP URI.  It was
                also specified as the default transport in RFC 2543 when no transport
                was present in the SIP URI.  However, another transport, such as TCP,
                MAY be used if the guidelines of SIP mandate it for this particular
                request.  That is the case, for example, for requests that exceed the
                path MTU.

                Otherwise, if no transport protocol or port is specified, and the
                target is not a numeric IP address, the client SHOULD perform a NAPTR
                query for the domain in the URI.  The services relevant for the task
                of transport protocol selection are those with NAPTR service fields
                with values "SIP+D2X" and "SIPS+D2X", where X is a letter that
                corresponds to a transport protocol supported by the domain.  This
                specification defines D2U for UDP, D2T for TCP, and D2S for SCTP.  We
                also establish an IANA registry for NAPTR service name to transport
                protocol mappings.

                These NAPTR records provide a mapping from a domain to the SRV record
                for contacting a server with the specific transport protocol in the
                NAPTR services field.  The resource record will contain an empty
                regular expression and a replacement value, which is the SRV record
                for that particular transport protocol.  If the server supports
                multiple transport protocols, there will be multiple NAPTR records,
                each with a different service value.  As per RFC 2915 [3], the client
                discards any records whose services fields are not applicable.  For
                the purposes of this specification, several rules are defined.

                First, a client resolving a SIPS URI MUST discard any services that
                do not contain "SIPS" as the protocol in the service field.  The
                converse is not true, however.  A client resolving a SIP URI SHOULD
                retain records with "SIPS" as the protocol, if the client supports
                TLS.  Second, a client MUST discard any service fields that identify
                a resolution service whose value is not "D2X", for values of X that
                indicate transport protocols supported by the client.  The NAPTR
                processing as described in RFC 2915 will result in the discovery of
                the most preferred transport protocol of the server that is supported
                by the client, as well as an SRV record for the server.  It will also
                allow the client to discover if TLS is available and its preference
                for its usage.

                As an example, consider a client that wishes to resolve
                sip:user@example.com.  The client performs a NAPTR query for that
                domain, and the following NAPTR records are returned:

                ;          order pref flags service      regexp  replacement
                    IN NAPTR 50   50  "s"  "SIPS+D2T"     ""  _sips._tcp.example.com.
                    IN NAPTR 90   50  "s"  "SIP+D2T"      ""  _sip._tcp.example.com
                    IN NAPTR 100  50  "s"  "SIP+D2U"      ""  _sip._udp.example.com.

                This indicates that the server supports TLS over TCP, TCP, and UDP,
                in that order of preference.  Since the client supports TCP and UDP,
                TCP will be used, targeted to a host determined by an SRV lookup of
                _sip._tcp.example.com.  That lookup would return:

                ;;          Priority Weight Port   Target
                    IN SRV  0        1      5060   server1.example.com
                    IN SRV  0        2      5060   server2.example.com

                If a SIP proxy, redirect server, or registrar is to be contacted
                through the lookup of NAPTR records, there MUST be at least three
                records - one with a "SIP+D2T" service field, one with a "SIP+D2U"
                service field, and one with a "SIPS+D2T" service field.  The records
                with SIPS as the protocol in the service field SHOULD be preferred
                (i.e., have a lower value of the order field) above records with SIP
                as the protocol in the service field.  A record with a "SIPS+D2U"
                service field SHOULD NOT be placed into the DNS, since it is not
                possible to use TLS over UDP.

                It is not necessary for the domain suffixes in the NAPTR replacement
                field to match the domain of the original query (i.e., example.com
                above).  However, for backwards compatibility with RFC 2543, a domain
                MUST maintain SRV records for the domain of the original query, even
                if the NAPTR record is in a different domain.  As an example, even
                though the SRV record for TCP is _sip._tcp.school.edu, there MUST
                also be an SRV record at _sip._tcp.example.com.

                RFC 2543 will look up the SRV records for the domain directly.  If
                these do not exist because the NAPTR replacement points to a
                different domain, the client will fail.

                For NAPTR records with SIPS protocol fields, (if the server is using
                a site certificate), the domain name in the query and the domain name
                in the replacement field MUST both be valid based on the site
                certificate handed out by the server in the TLS exchange.  Similarly,
                the domain name in the SRV query and the domain name in the target in
                the SRV record MUST both be valid based on the same site certificate.
                Otherwise, an attacker could modify the DNS records to contain
                replacement values in a different domain, and the client could not
                validate that this was the desired behavior or the result of an
                attack.

                If no NAPTR records are found, the client constructs SRV queries for
                those transport protocols it supports, and does a query for each.
                Queries are done using the service identifier "_sip" for SIP URIs and
                "_sips" for SIPS URIs.  A particular transport is supported if the
                query is successful.  The client MAY use any transport protocol it
                desires which is supported by the server.

                This is a change from RFC 2543.  It specified that a client would
                lookup SRV records for all transports it supported, and merge the
                priority values across those records.  Then, it would choose the
                most preferred record.

                If no SRV records are found, the client SHOULD use TCP for a SIPS
                URI, and UDP for a SIP URI.  However, another transport protocol,
                such as TCP, MAY be used if the guidelines of SIP mandate it for this
                particular request.  That is the case, for example, for requests that
                exceed the path MTU.

            #region RFC 3263 4.2 Determining Port and IP Address

            /* 4.2 Determining Port and IP Address

                If TARGET is a numeric IP address, the client uses that address.  If
                the URI also contains a port, it uses that port.  If no port is
                specified, it uses the default port for the particular transport
                protocol.

                If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, but a port is present in
                the URI, the client performs an A or AAAA record lookup of the domain
                name.  The result will be a list of IP addresses, each of which can
                be contacted at the specific port from the URI and transport protocol
                determined previously.  The client SHOULD try the first record.  If
                an attempt should fail, based on the definition of failure in Section
                4.3, the next SHOULD be tried, and if that should fail, the next
                SHOULD be tried, and so on.

                This is a change from RFC 2543.  Previously, if the port was
                explicit, but with a value of 5060, SRV records were used.  Now, A
                or AAAA records will be used.

                If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, and no port was present
                in the URI, the client performs an SRV query on the record returned
                from the NAPTR processing of Section 4.1, if such processing was
                performed.  If it was not, because a transport was specified
                explicitly, the client performs an SRV query for that specific
                transport, using the service identifier "_sips" for SIPS URIs.  For a
                SIP URI, if the client wishes to use TLS, it also uses the service
                identifier "_sips" for that specific transport, otherwise, it uses
                "_sip".  If the NAPTR processing was not done because no NAPTR
                records were found, but an SRV query for a supported transport
                protocol was successful, those SRV records are selected. Irregardless
                of how the SRV records were determined, the procedures of RFC 2782,
                as described in the section titled "Usage rules" are followed,
                augmented by the additional procedures of Section 4.3 of this
                document.

                If no SRV records were found, the client performs an A or AAAA record
                lookup of the domain name.  The result will be a list of IP
                addresses, each of which can be contacted using the transport
                protocol determined previously, at the default port for that
                transport.  Processing then proceeds as described above for an
                explicit port once the A or AAAA records have been looked up.
