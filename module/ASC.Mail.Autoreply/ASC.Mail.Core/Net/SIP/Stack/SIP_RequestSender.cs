                            The destination for the request is then computed.  Unless there is
                            local policy specifying otherwise, the destination MUST be determined
                            by applying the DNS procedures described in [4] as follows.  If the
                            first element in the route set indicated a strict router (resulting
                            in forming the request as described in Section 12.2.1.1), the
                            procedures MUST be applied to the Request-URI of the request.
                            Otherwise, the procedures are applied to the first Route header field
                            value in the request (if one exists), or to the request's Request-URI
                            if there is no Route header field present.  These procedures yield an
                            ordered set of address, port, and transports to attempt.  Independent
                            of which URI is used as input to the procedures of [4], if the
                            Request-URI specifies a SIPS resource, the UAC MUST follow the
                            procedures of [4] as if the input URI were a SIPS URI.
                 
                            The UAC SHOULD follow the procedures defined in [4] for stateful
                            elements, trying each address until a server is contacted.  Each try
                            constitutes a new transaction, and therefore each carries a different
                            topmost Via header field value with a new branch parameter.
                            Furthermore, the transport value in the Via header field is set to
                            whatever transport was determined for the target server.

                The Contact header field provides a SIP or SIPS URI that can be used
                to contact that specific instance of the UA for subsequent requests.
                The Contact header field MUST be present and contain exactly one SIP
                or SIPS URI in any request that can result in the establishment of a
                dialog.  For the methods defined in this specification, that includes
                only the INVITE request.  For these requests, the scope of the
                Contact is global.  That is, the Contact header field value contains
                the URI at which the UA would like to receive requests, and this URI
                MUST be valid even if used in subsequent requests outside of any
                dialogs.

                If the Request-URI or top Route header field value contains a SIPS
                URI, the Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS URI as well.
