                    random 32-bit quantity redrawn for every compound packet transmitted. 

                 SR or RR
                    The first RTCP packet in the compound packet must always be a report 
                    packet to facilitate header validation as described in Appendix A.2. 
                    This is true even if no data has been sent nor received, in which case an 
                    empty RR is sent, and even if the only other RTCP packet in the compound packet is a BYE. 

                 Additional RRs
                    If the number of sources for which reception statistics are being reported 
                    exceeds 31, the number that will fit into one SR or RR packet, then additional 
                    RR packets should follow the initial report packet. 

                 SDES
                    An SDES packet containing a CNAME item must be included in each compound RTCP packet. 
                    Other source description items may optionally be included if required by a particular 
                    application, subject to bandwidth constraints (see Section 6.2.2). 

                 BYE or APP
                    Other RTCP packet types, including those yet to be defined, may follow in any order, 
                    except that BYE should be the last packet sent with a given SSRC/CSRC. 
                    Packet types may appear more than once.

                o  RTP version field must equal 2.

                o  The payload type field of the first RTCP packet in a compound
                   packet must be equal to SR or RR.

                o  The padding bit (P) should be zero for the first packet of a
                   compound RTCP packet because padding should only be applied, if it
                   is needed, to the last packet.

                o  The length fields of the individual RTCP packets must add up to
                   the overall length of the compound RTCP packet as received.  This
                   is a fairly strong check.
